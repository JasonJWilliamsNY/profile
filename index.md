# Affiliation and work

I've worked at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) since 2004, first
at the bench in the Plant Science group and currently as Assistant Director,
External Collaborations of the lab's [DNA Learning Center](http://www.dnalc.org). I
also get to teach my own science course a few hours a week at
[Yeshiva University High School for Girls](http://www.yushg.org).

# Workshops, talks, teaching, and presentations

This list mainly reflects my work with [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org) (formerly
iPlant Collaborative),a project I work on that brings Cyberinfrascture to biologists.
I am their Education, Outreach, and Training lead, so I get to help lots of
biologists use computation in their teaching and research. Workshops are mainly
multi-day training events.
