# Professional Profile

    "You're like a celebrity that isn't famous"
    - E.M.; The 2nd best compliment I've ever received
    "Pull back three curtains and there's Jason"
    - C.T.B.; The 5th best compliment I've ever received
    "You are an NBC sitcom but the writers room has the good cocaine"
    - C.K.; The 17th best compliment I've ever received

An incomplete list of things I do and have done, if you have to know for some
reason.

I've worked at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) since 2004, first
at the bench in the Plant Science group and currently as Assistant Director,
External Collaborations of the lab's [DNA Learning Center](http://www.dnalc.org). I
also get to teach my own science course a few hours a week at
[Yeshiva University High School for Girls](http://www.yushg.org).
I think helping scientists keep up with changing technology is one of the most
important things we can do to accelerate research. Moreover I think this can
be sustainably achieved by building, supporting, and promoting the people who
do this training - hence my founding of the group [Life Science Trainers](https://lifescitrainers.org/),
a global community of practice for short-format training in the life sciences (
open to anyone who provides training for life scientists).

# Workshops, Talks, Teaching, and Presentations

This list significantly includes my work with [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org), a project I work on that brings cyberinfrastructure to biologists.
I am their Education, Outreach, and Training lead, so I get to help lots of
biologists use computation in their teaching and research. Workshops are mainly
multi-day training events.

## Travel Tips and Recommendations

I travel a fair bit. Here are some of my favorite items for the road-warrior scientist

**Travel Essentials**

|Category|Item|Link|Notes|
|--------|----|----|-----|
|Bag|Arkiv Modular Backpack|[link](https://missionworkshop.com/products/arkiv-bag-series)|This is my FAVORITE bag. I have the rucksack for everyday use, but this is a buy-it-for life quality travel bag. You can fully customize the bag for all your travel needs. I have the large 40L R6. I have compartments for my laptop, iPad/small electronics, and water bottle. You can add more accessories as needed. I have gone on a 10-day international trip including an clothes and an extra pair of shoes with just this bag. You will only need one.|
|Bag|Adidas Rumble Sack|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P28C67U/)|The Arkiv bag can split into smaller bags, but is too much for days on a trip when I am not flying. This bag is very light, sturdy, and good for carrying my laptop and few small supplies. Also nice if you are going shopping for a few small things.|
|AV equipment (airplane iPad holder)|High View|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NNTO2JA/)|This is perfect for watching movies on your iPad mini or other small tablet on a plane. Even when a TV is available, I usually am watching highbrow classical concerts not available even in first-class. This will secure your small tablet to the seat in front of you.|
|Bag|Foldable Duffle Bag|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KZN263K/)|You never know when a casual seminar will turn into a bank heist. This foldable duffle bag is helpful if you do a fair bit of shopping on your trip and need the extra room. Also on a longer trip, I will use this with my carry-on bag.|
|Suitcase/carry-on|Zuca Flyer Business Bag|[link](https://www.zuca.com/control/product/~product_id=11940)|This really is the ULTIMATE suitcase. It is a carry-on size, but this plus the Arikiv are a month's worth of clothes for me - especially if I also bring the duffle bag. This is an indestructible bag. If you need to make repairs you can find what you need at Home Depot. It also doubles as a seat when you are waiting at the gate.|
|Travel accessory|Bag Bungie|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TR0UZI/)|I secure this to my carry-on and then can add a duffle bag on top|
|Travel accessory|Jacket grip|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRD3VWN)|Lets you easily hang a jacket from your bag. I haven't tried, but I bet this would help with a poster tube as well|
|Travel accessory|Travel vacuum bags|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015456YZ0)|This is a must. You can compress all your clothes without a vacuum. Just roll the air out using these bags. This is one of several brands I have used. Cary an extra one to keep your worn dainty unmentionables separated.|
|Travel accessory|Travel umbrella|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1RGBU/)|A dependable, lightweight umbrella.|
|Travel accessory|RFID neck stash wallet|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0082C62BO)|If you will be visiting shady locales, this may help keep your valuables safe.|
|Travel accessory|Sleep mask|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSO1D9O/)|Comfortable!|
|Travel accessory|Ostrich Pillow|[link](https://ostrichpillow.com/)|For when you must block the outside world out.|
|Travel accessory - electronic|Bluetooth Speaker|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016XTADG2)|I have to surround myself with music. This is very loud, compact, and holds a charge.|
|Travel accessory - electronic |Lightning cables|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HXYNYUS/)|These cables for Apple mobile products won't crack.|
|Travel accessory - electronic|External battery|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2T7U90/)|Provides several charges for phone and iPad. Buy whatever you need but make sure that the mAh are not above [TSA/FAA standards](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/passenger_info/media/Airline_passengers_and_batteries.pdf); some countries you travel to may also have local standards - I've lost batteries this way. |
|Travel accessory - electronic|Travel adaptor|[link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y3ABJKS/)|Perfect for foreign travel and has USB ports.|
|Travel accessory - electronic|Parrot Headphone|[link](https://www.amazon.com/Parrot-Zik-3-Black-Leather-grain/dp/B016Y37M4I/)|My choice for noise-cancelling headphones. Make sure to get an [extra battery.](https://www.amazon.com/HeadphoneMate-Rechargeable-Battery-Parrot-Headphones/dp/B013WSBTV0/)|
|Travel accessory - electronic|Lapa Bluetooth tracker|[link](https://www.amazon.com/LAPA-Blue-everything-matters-phone/dp/B01EIKHNNY/)|I have a few that I can put in my bags. Besides the ability to help you find a lost item (in theory) via crowdsourced GPS; you can set a safety mode which will inform you if you (or your item) is more than a certain distance away.|

**Other Travel Items**
- laser pointer/remote (e.g. [link](https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Wireless-Presenter-Pointer-K72426AM/dp/B009K1PYG0/))
- Extra backup dongle (computer to projector)
- Wireless hotspot (don't reply on hotel wireless, if you have a dedicated hotspot, buy it from a different carrier than your phone)
- VPN software (e.g. [Express](https://www.expressvpn.com/) or [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) - Wireless on the airplane/airport is not at all secure. You may also need a VPN when traveling abroad)

**Travel Pharmacopeia - liniments and snake oils**

Drugs are an essential part of travel; conferences are germ cesspools. Be prepared.
Also, anyone with a little MacGyver ingenuity and a first-year pharmacy degree will
recognize the possibilities in my selections should they find themselves kidnapped
by nefarious forces.

- **Travel Lysol**: Sanitize your airplane seat and anything you will touch or sleep on during the trip.
- **Alcohol wipes**: Take several of these. Buy a good brand, but not too many because they dry out. Keep them everywhere because you will be in front of food and realize you have nothing to clean your hands with.
- **Analgesics**: Aspirin, Tylenol, and Advil for fevers, aches, sunburn etc.
- **Hypnotics**: If you are traveling several time zones, a melatonin supplement is nice (low dose)
  is better. A diphenhydramine sleeping pill is also good. Avoid prescription ones if you can.
- **Anti-cold/flu**: I like to have some daytime/nighttime cold medication pills like NyQuill. I also am a fan of [Zicam](http://www.zicam.com/) which works for me. In addition, a Cepacol lozenge, or something that has benzocaine is great for a sore throat. I also like to have a menthol inhaler stick for congestion. You can also save a bottle of Jack Daniels or other whiskey from your plane ride.
- **Ointment and Creams**: Take plenty of lotions (planes are very dehydrating). I am a fan of Aveeno and also unscented Shea butter products like [Out of Africa](http://outofafricashea.com/). Burts Bees lip balms are also good for winter travel. [Bubble bath](http://www.mrbubble.com/) products can be brought in your checked bags, or you can carry a small amount for shorter trips. Of course Frankincense, Myrrh, Sage, and other oils are a must. Don't forget anti mosquito creams like [Odomos](http://odomosprotect.com/) - mosquitos are everywhere, [for now](https://www.nature.com/news/gene-drive-mosquitoes-engineered-to-fight-malaria-1.18858).
- **Things you may not think you need**: Especially in a foreign country, you may not know where to find a pharmacist, or you may have difficulty communicating. See the [CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel) for country-specific recommendations - including an Anti-diarrheal and Anti-allergy (I never had an allergy attack until one foreign trip), dental filling repair kit, etc.


**Travel Phrase Book**

If you are going to a place where your language is not spoken, keep some kind of
book (paper/electronic) with useful phrases. Most languages will have an App you can download
with the more common phrases. Here are some phrases you might not find in an App, but which
I have always found useful. I will be adding to this, and also some translations. I am grateful
for additions or corrections to translations so please submit a pull request.
